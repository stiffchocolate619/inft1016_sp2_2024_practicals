                <h2>Wieu's First Year Studying Software Engineering</h2>
                <p>In my first semester, I've been introduced to the foundational elements of Software Engineering. This includes learning Python programming, where I've grasped the basics of coding and how to create simple programs. I've also explored network fundamentals, which has given me an understanding of how data moves across networks and the basics of network security. Additionally, studying Information Technology Fundamentals has broadened my knowledge of computer hardware, software, and information systems. These courses have provided me with a strong starting point, and I'm excited to continue building on this knowledge in the future.</p>
